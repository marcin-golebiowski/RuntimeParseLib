RuntimeParseLib
===============

The goal of this project is to develop a library that simplifies the dynamic generation of lexers and parsers at
runtime, and builds upon these foundations to provide a complete text processing system that uses serialization
and xml configuration to define records and record reading behavior. So far, the library only has support for
the generation of some simple types of lexers, but as of that accomplishment the project is less than a week old.
